# Innovation Women Platform – Strategy & Financial Growth Model

This project presents a dual-strategy business model and profitability simulation for **Innovation Women**, a platform that promotes visibility for women speakers. It combines **financial modeling**, **user retention analytics**, and **growth projections** to improve platform engagement and revenue generation.

---

##  Objective

To enhance user experience, increase profitability, and drive retention by:
- Implementing a **personalized event-matching algorithm**
- Offering **bundled pricing strategies** for speaker subscriptions
- Simulating financial scenarios based on user volume

---

##  Strategic Solutions Proposed

###  Strategy 1: Matching Algorithm (Conceptual)
- Uses NLP to recommend speakers for events based on:
  - Industry overlap
  - Historical speaking topics
  - Engagement profiles

### Strategy 2: Bundled Subscription Model
- $19.99/month (individual) → $99/6-month bundle
- Includes features like:
  - Personalized onboarding
  - Pitch assistance
  - Algorithmic event matching

---

## Financial Simulation Outcomes

- **95% retention** projected with bundled strategy
- Break-even at just **50 users**
- Scalable to **$229,000+ net profit** with 500 users
- Simulation considers:
  - CAC, churn rate, and operating expenses
  - Revenue from individual vs bundled pricing

---

##  Tools & Skills Used

- Python (for simulation logic)
- Excel (for cost modeling and retention curves)
- Business strategy frameworks (Value Prop, TAM analysis)
- Stakeholder value maps and C-Suite presentation prep
